# EmployeeManagementSystem
The project contain 5 clases: DBConnection, Employee, EmployeeDaoImpl, EmloyeeDaoInterface and Main.
For DBConnection I used mySQL-connector-java-8.0.30.jar.
In Workbanch I've created a database named employeedb, with foloowing columns : ID, name, salary and age.
When the project is running, first we have a menu for: 

Press "1" for Add Employee;
Press "2" for Show All Employee;
Press "3" Show Employee based on id; 
Press "4" Update the employee;
Press "5" Delete the employee;
Press "6" for exist.
Enter Choice:
