# EmployeeManagementSystem
The project contain 5 clases: DBConnection, Employee, EmployeeDaoImpl, EmloyeeDaoInterface and Main.
For DBConnection I used mySQL-connector-java-8.0.30.jar.
In Workbanch I've created a database named employeedb, with foloowing columns : ID, name, salary and age.
When the project is running, first we have a menu for: 
1. Add Employee
2. Show All Employee
3. Show Employee based on id 
4. Update the employee
5. Delete the employee
All the changes made are transmitted in the created database.
